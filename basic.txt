For prediction we need data-set that can be feeded to computer and need good statistical algorithm that can train and 
distinguish the data to target the correct output. 
Classification -> prediction of discrete value outcomes.
1. Binary classification -> only have two classes 
one vs one.
2. Multi-class classification -> (optical character recognition, face recognition) can addoped from binary classification 
one vs one / one vs rest.
3. Multi-label classification -> multiple things in a picture and lebel them
can't use 1 and 2.
4. Imbalance classification -> task of classification where the number of instances in each class are unqually distributed
(most of the problem are here).
5. Multioutput-multiclass classification (multi-task) -> single classifier handles several joint classification task
using in the relm of deep learning.
e.g. NLP we jointly use NLP tasks, parts of speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, language modeling.
