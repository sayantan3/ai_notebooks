Based on Bayes' theorem
P(A/B) = (P(B/A) * P(A)) / P(B)
where, 
P(A/B) conditional probability of A, given B has occurred - posterior probability 
Posterior probability is a probability of an event after evidence is seen
P(A) - probability of A (prior probability - probability of event before evidence is seen) 
P(B) - evidence 
P(B/A) - conditional probatility of B, given A is occurred - Likelihood

works very well fo rNatural Language Problems - document classification and spam filtering
