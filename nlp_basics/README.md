Implement and understand NLP fundamentals.
1. Beam search and greedy search.
2. Working principle:
Input -> Encoder -> (Encoder Out) -> Decoder -> (Decoder Out)
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                    V
                                                  Linear 
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                    V
                                                  Softmax -> Charecter Probability -> Output
